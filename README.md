## Skills

- Great collaborator - I always try to help those around me and learn from others in turn. With my legal background, I am able to use my communication skills to digest technical concepts and explain them in a simple way. My biggest joy from my final bootcamp project at Makers was explaining concepts such as event-based two-way communication with Socket.io to my team members, and seeing them implement it themselves!
- Self-learner - I am passionate about learning new concepts and technologies, and am never afraid of getting stuck in with a new language and diving into documentation and Google searches. This is reflected by not only the range of tech used in my projects, but from my hobbies as I also enjoy learning new things such as dance and guitar.
- Diligence - From practicing new hobbies to programming, I have the self-discipline and diligence to keep progressing while still paying attention to detail. This can be seen in my hobbies such as in gaming, I worked hard to achieve my goal of being a Top 3000 Player in Dota 2. This translates to my programming, for example, through my frequent Github commit history with which I still maintain detailed READMEs, and my frequent use of Test-Driven Development for several projects.
